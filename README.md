# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-the-Heart-Failure-patients-dataset-from-UCI

The purpose of EDA is to use descriptive statistics and visualizations to better understand data, and find clues about the tendencies of the data, its quality and to formulate assumptions and the hypothesis of our analysis. EDA is NOT about making fancy visualizations or even aesthetically pleasing ones; the goal is to try and answer questions with data. The primary objective of my project is to uncover the underlying structure in the dataset. From the structure, we should be able to determine the trends, patterns and relationships among the attributes of the dataset using descriptive statistics and visualization. After performing the exploration of the dataset and uncovering the underlying structure and relationships in the dataset, I will be supposing a general form for the relationships (which is going to be my regression model). The regression model will be used to predict a dependent variable based on a set of explanatory variables “independent variables” related to the dependent variable. At the end of the project, I hope to have the answer to a burning question; “Why does the dependent variable take different values for different sample/population of data?”.
